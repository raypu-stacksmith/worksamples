# Data Analysis Projects & Coursework

This repository contains a collection of my data analysis work, academic projects, and independent explorations across statistics, data science, and applied analytics. The projects span multiple domains and emphasize rigorous methodology, clear communication, and reproducible workflows.

## Overview

The work in this repository includes:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Statistical modeling and inference
- Regression, generalized additive models (GAMs), and interaction analysis
- Bayesian modeling and simulation
- Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering
- Applied analytics for business, policy, and engineering contexts

Projects are implemented with a focus on interpretability, statistical validity, and real-world relevance.

## Tools & Technologies

Common tools and languages used throughout this repository include:
- **R** (tidyverse, ggplot2, mgcv, rstan)
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- **SQL**
- **Excel / Power BI**
- **LaTeX / Overleaf** for academic reporting

## Project Structure

Projects are typically organized with:
- `data/` – raw or processed datasets (when shareable)
- `scripts/` or `analysis/` – analysis and modeling code
- `figures/` – visualizations and plots
- `reports/` – written summaries or technical reports

Each project folder includes a brief description of the research question, data sources, methods, and key findings.

## Topics Covered

Examples of topics explored include:
- Salary and compensation analysis
- Housing and public policy data
- Marketing and operations analytics
- Renewable energy and mobility-related data
- Simulation-based inference and uncertainty quantification

## Notes

Some datasets are omitted or partially redacted due to privacy or licensing restrictions. All analysis reflects my own work unless otherwise stated.
